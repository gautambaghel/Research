abstract = {Despite its vast enthusiast community and influence on contemporary game designers,$\backslash$nthe MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) remains under-explored by academics. This$\backslash$npaper considers many meanings of ``well played'' reflected in the design, community, and$\backslash$naesthetics of the genre's most popular member, League of Legends.$\backslash$nOriginating as modifications of commercial RTS (real-time strategy) games, MOBAs$\backslash$npresent a rare study of the ``rhetoric of the imaginary'' in play theory applied to popular$\backslash$ngame design. The genre's reification in commercial forms such as League show how the$\backslash$nattitudes of distributed design projects manifest themselves as values of play.$\backslash$nA close reading of the phases in a match of League of Legends exposes one possible$\backslash$naesthetic framework for the consideration of eSports. Greg Costikyan's theory of$\backslash$nuncertainty in play serves here as a backbone for the study of conventions, tension,$\backslash$nstrategy, and tactics in a team-based competitive videogame.},

In these games, teams of players fight against each other in arena environments, and the gameplay is focussed on tactical combat. In this paper, we present three data-driven measures of spatio-temporal behaviour in Defence of the Ancients 2 (DotA 2): 1) Zone changes; 2) Distribution of team members and: 3) Time series clustering via a fuzzy approach. We present a method for obtaining accurate positional data from DotA 2. We investigate how behaviour varies across these measures as a function of the skill level of teams, using four tiers from novice to professional players. Results from three analyses indicate that spatio-temporal behaviour of MOBA teams is highly related to team skill.},

Drawing on the data from a study that involves 38 virtual teams of MBA students performing a complex web-based business simulation game over an 8-week period, we found that in the early stage of the project, the frequency and volume of task-oriented communications among team mem bers played an important role informing expertise location and cognition-based trust. Once TMS were established, however, task-oriented communication became less impor tant. Instead, toward the end of the project, task-knowledge coordination emerges as a key construct that influences team performance, mediating the impact of all other constructs. Our study demonstrates that TMS can be formed even in virtual team environments where interactions take place solely through electronic media, although they take a relatively long time to develop. Furthermore, our findings show that, once developed, TMS become essential to performing tasks effectively in virtual teams.},

In particular, hidden traitor games, in which one or more players is secretly working against the group mission, has the effect of increasing paranoia and distrust between players, so this paper looks into the opposite of a hidden traitor – a hidden benefactor. Rather than sabotaging the group mission, the hidden benefactor would help the group achieve the end goal while still having a reason to stay hidden. The paper explores what games with such a role can look like and how the role changes player interactions. Finally, the paper addresses the divide between video game and board game interaction modes; hidden roles are not common within video games, but they are of growing prevalence in board games. This fact, combined with the exploration of hidden benefactors, reveals that hidden roles is a mechanic that video games should develop into in order to match board games' complexity of player interaction modes.},

Multi-player online battle arena games are among the most successful games in this regard. In order to execute complex team-based strategies, players take on very specific roles within a team. This paper investigates the applicability of supervised machine learning to classifying player behavior in terms of specific and commonly accepted but not formally well-defined roles within a team of players of the game Dota 2. We provide an in-depth discussion and novel approaches for constructing complex attributes from low-level data extracted from replay files. Using attribute evaluation techniques, we are able to reduce a larger set of candidate attributes down to a manageable number. Based on this resulting set of attributes, we compare and discuss the performance of a variety of supervised classification algorithms. Our results with a data set of 708 labeled players see logistic regression as the overall most stable and best performing classifier.},

Moreover, player skill analysis becomes more intriguing in team-based video games because such form of study can help discover useful factors in effective team formation. In this paper, we consider the problem of skill decomposition in MOBA (MultiPlayer Online Battle Arena) games, with the goal to understand what player skill factors are essential for the outcome of a game match. To understand the construct of MOBA player skills, we utilize various skill-based predictive models to decompose player skills into interpretative parts, the impact of which are assessed in statistical terms. We apply this analysis approach on two widely known MOBAs, namely League of Legends (LoL) and Defense of the Ancients 2 (DOTA2). The finding is that base skills of in-game avatars, base skills of players, and players' champion-specific skills are three prominent skill components influencing LoL's match outcomes, while those of DOTA2 are mainly impacted by in-game avatars' base skills but not much by the other two.},

@article{Drachen2013,
abstract = {The analysis of user behavior in digital games has been aided by the introduction of user telemetry in game development, which provides unprecedented access to quantitative data on user behavior from the installed game clients of the entire population of players. Player behavior telemetry datasets can be exceptionally complex, with features recorded for a varying population of users over a temporal segment that can reach years in duration. Categorization of behaviors, whether through descriptive methods (e.g. segmentation) or unsupervised/supervised learning techniques, is valuable for finding patterns in the behavioral data, and developing profiles that are actionable to game developers. There are numerous methods for unsupervised clustering of user behavior, e.g. k-means/c-means, Non- negative Matrix Factorization, or Principal Component Analysis. Although all yield behavior categorizations, interpretation of the resulting categories in terms of actual play behavior can be difficult if not impossible. In this paper, a range of unsupervised techniques are applied together with Archetypal Analysis to develop behavioral clusters from playtime data of 70,014 World of Warcraft players, covering a five year interval. The techniques are evaluated with respect to their ability to develop actionable behavioral profiles from the dataset.},

@article{Bainbridge2009,
abstract = {This lecture introduces fundamental principles of online multiplayer games, primarily massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), suitable for students and faculty interested both in designing games and in doing research on them. The general focus is human-centered computing, which includes many human-computer interaction issues and emphasizes social computing, but also, looks at how the design of socio-economic interactions extends our traditional notions of computer programming to cover human beings as well as machines. In addition, it demonstrates a range of social science research methodologies, both quantitative and qualitative, that could be used by students for term papers, or by their professors for publications. In addition to drawing upon a rich literature about these games, this lecture is based on thousands of hours of first-hand research experience inside many classic examples, including World of Warcraft, The Matrix Online, Anarchy Online, Tabula Rasa, Ent opia Universe, Dark Age of Camelot, Age of Conan, Lord of the Rings Online, Tale in the Desert, EVE Online, Star Wars Galaxies, Pirates of the Burning Sea, and the non-game virtual world Second Life. Among the topics covered are historical-cultural origins of leading games, technical constraints that shape the experience, rolecoding and social control, player personality and motivation, relationships with avatars and characters, virtual professions and economies, social relations inside games, and the implications for the external society.

@article{Balthazard2004,
abstract = {This study investigates how a personality trait and expertise affect virtual teams interaction, and how that interaction leads to different levels of performance (e.g., solution quality, solution acceptance, cohesion). Teams have been shown to exhibit constructive, aggressive/defensive, or passive/defensive interaction styles that affect communication and thus team performance by facilitating or hindering the exchange of information among group members. These styles reflect an aggregation of the behaviors exhibited by individual team members, which are rooted in their individual personalities. The effects of interaction style on team performance have been well established in face-to-face and virtual teams. Generally, constructive interaction styles produce positive outcomes whereas passive/defensive styles beget negative ones. Aggressive/defensive teams produce solutions that are correlated with the expertise of those that have wrested control of the group -but there is often little support for those solutions. The current work explores how different constellations of extraversion and expertise manifest themselves into group interaction styles and, ultimately, outcomes. The study involves 248 professional managers from executive MBA and professional development programs in 63 virtual teams that performed an intellective task. Results show that expertise and extraversion to be curvilinearly related to group interactions and performance, and high levels of extraversion and higher variations in extraversion between team members lead to less constructive and more passive/defensive interaction styles within teams. Results show that although expertise is the best predictor of task performance, it is primarily group interaction styles that predict contextual outcomes (e.g., solution acceptance, cohesion, effectiveness) in virtual teams.},

These games are very popular and by nature numerical, they provide many tracks that we analyzed in terms of team play. We studied Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), where two teams battle in a game very similar to rugby or American football. Through topological measures – area of polygon described by the players, inertia, diameter, distance to the base – that are independent of the exact nature of the game, we show that the outcome of the match can be relevantly predicted. Mining e-sport's tracks is opening interest in further application of these tools for analyzing real time sport.},
